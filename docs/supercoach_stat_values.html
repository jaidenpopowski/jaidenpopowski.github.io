<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Explaining the SuperCoach AFL scoring
system</h1>
<h4 class="date">27/01/2024</h4>

</div>


<div style="display: flex;">
<div class="column" style="width:55%;">
<p>SuperCoach AFL is a very popular fantasy sports game in Australia.
Footy fans become the ‘coach’ of a fantasy team, where each player is
scored each match based on their game performance. It has just opened to
the public for 2024 and avid punters can now put together their starting
squad.</p>
<p>The main premise of SuperCoach, and its scoring system in particular,
is that every action in a game of Australian Football has an impact on
the result of the match. Some actions are more important than others.
Players can determine a game in a shot for goal, or save their lead in a
massive pack-mark on the goal line. In essence, each statistic is scored
on how much it improves the chances of winning.</p>
<p>However, this scoring system is kept secret - we essentially have to
believe what each player scores is legitimate. There is no definitive
list of which stats are included, or how collated stats get broken down,
leaving the community to guess what is going on. My offseason project is
to figure out which stats matter, what they’re all worth, and create
advanced player stats. Let’s go!</p>
</div>
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<p><img src="img/supercoach_article/teamexample.PNG" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="where-do-we-start" class="section level1">
<h1>Where do we start?</h1>
<p>I’ve spent the offseason researching the game of SuperCoach and which
stats might be included in the scoring system. This includes browsing X
(Twitter), online AFL forums,
<a href= "https://www.championdata.com/glossary/afl/">the Champion Data
glossary</a>, but as a student I didn’t wanna pay up for a Herald Sun
subscription. It probably would’ve been wise in hindsight…</p>
<p>At the heart of the ranking points system is that it considers
players winning the ball, disposing of it, and where on the ground they
do it. It seems that we only need to focus on the things a player does
with the ball, plus a few of the simpler defensive actions.</p>
<p>Last year, I attempted this same feat by applying “known” values to
each match. For example, we’ve heard that goals are worth 8 points.
While this is more useful than nothing, SuperCoach has deeper
intricacies to its scoring system. Unlike other fantasy games, ranking
points are weighted and adjusted by the time-elapsed in a match and the
current margin. This means that scoring in close games looks a lot
different to scoring in a blowout. A goal could be 10 points or 5; it
always changes.</p>
<p>We also know that events that happen in <strong>D50 or F50</strong>
are <strong>worth ~20% more</strong> compared to the midfield. You are
rewarded more for perfoming acts in scoring zones. Finally, SuperCoach
also stick to the ‘3300 rule’ - a match scaling rule that ensures every
game finishes with the same amount of points.</p>
<p>After review of last year’s analysis, which had good (but unusable)
results, I decided that I need to get fancier. I needed more match
statistics than ever before, and it seemed there was enough variety
across AFL stats sources - the AFL website, the AFL app, Champion Data,
and other match centres.</p>
<p>With my research in mind, I came up with a plan of action:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Collect, calculate and collate as many statistics as
possible</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the zone in which each stat occurred (D50, MID, F50)
for more precision</p></li>
<li><p>Create a model to weight all the stats with respect to each
player’s final score</p></li>
<li><p>Remove statistics that are insignificant or better described in
more detail</p></li>
<li><p>Add scaling to the 3300 figure for each match</p></li>
<li><p>Summarise the results and present the <strong>average</strong>
value each stat is worth</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="sourcing-the-advanced-stats" class="section level1">
<h1>Sourcing the advanced stats</h1>
<div style="display: flex;">
<div class="column" style="width:55%;">
<p>You might be familiar with the possibilities of Stats Pro in the AFL
app. On mobile, you can watch player highlights in short clips of their
involvements for the match.</p>
<p>The best thing about this feature is that every stat is time-stamped.
I first started by downloading every player’s set of actions from each
match, and then combined them all in chronological order. This means we
can view each game from an individual stat perspective, and we can get
an idea of how the ball moves.</p>
<p>This has changed how I work with statistics for the fantasy
platforms, as I am now assessing player performance via when they win
the ball, the state in which they get involved (stoppages, turnover,
etc) and where on the ground they are. The last point is the key - we
know that SuperCoach points are likely to be boosted when in
defensive-50 or forward-50.</p>

<div class="figcaption">Will Hoskin-Elliott gathers and kicks the ball
to seal Collingwood’s 2023 premiership!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can combine these new stats with what we already have from the AFL
website and other stats providers to <em>hopefully</em> give us
everything we need for an accurate model.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-model" class="section level1">
<h1>The model</h1>
<p>I’ve been collecting data from these sources, but unfortunately a lot
of it has been manual interpretation. This includes calculating kick
distances, kick direction, kick effectiveness, how the kick was
received, who generated score assists, whether each mark was from a
teammate or opponent, the result of spoils, kick-in playing on vs taking
it from the square, the result of hitouts… it was a complicated task.
Oh, and grouping every stat by D50, MID or F50 zones! It was certainly
an entire-offseason project.</p>
<p>With all stats collected, we should be able to calculate an
<strong>average</strong> points value for each stat across all game
scenarios - close or a blowout. As every game is worth the same
approximate 3300 points, the scaling should be similar across all games
too. What this means is that we can estimate what our players typically
get rewarded for a specific act on the footy field.</p>
<p>To find an average value for each statistic, I’ve decided to go with
a simple linear model where we try to minimise deviation from the real
score. My results yielded a <strong>R-squared value of 0.968</strong>,
meaning that 96.8% of variation in SuperCoach scoring is explained by
this model. I think that’s pretty good considering we aren’t scaling
stats based on the margin or how much of the game has elapsed! The
<strong>mean absolute error (MAE)</strong> for each SuperCoach score was
<strong>4.23</strong>, meaning that on average, this model was only 4.23
points off the real SuperCoach score for each player.</p>
<p>This is a <em>significant</em> improvement from the last time
<a href="https://jaidenpopowski.github.io/StatsByJaiden/">I tried to
figure out SuperCoach scoring</a>, which had results of 90.2% R-squared
and 7.81 MAE, and had a lot of scaling issues.</p>

<div id="whats-not-included" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s not included?</h3>
<p>Many common stats used in the AFL landscape are not actually included
in the all-encompassing SuperCoach formula. Typically these stats are
better broken down by stats already mentioned. For example, most
clearances have both a possession and a disposal that comprise a
clearance. I’m confident that these stats aren’t included based on their
lack of statistical significance on the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearances (better scored as possession + disposal)</li>
<li>Inside-50s (disposal + potential score/assist)</li>
<li>Metres Gained (long kicks bonus)</li>
<li>Hitouts (0)</li>
<li>Ineffective Kicks/Handballs (0)</li>
<li>Score Launches (usually involves an intercept)</li>
<li>Score Involvements (only the assist player or scorer)</li>
<li>Pressure Acts</li>
<li>Turnovers (40m+ long kicks can be effective yet still turn the ball
over)</li>
<li>1-on-1 marking contest wins/losses (Contested Mark)</li>
<li>Intercepts (either intercept mark or a gather from opposition)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope you have gained some clarity on the facets that are important
for scoring in SuperCoach AFL. It’s been a long process and
<em>many</em> hours browsing Twitter, BigFooty and using the fancy
exploits of Google Search to gain info from paywalled articles.
Ultimately, we won’t ever get all the pieces due to intellectual
property policies, but I really wanted to understand where players
excel.</p>
<p>The benefit of this analysis is that unlike ever before, we can look
at how players score their points. Each game’s stats are now calculated
for all players and we can answer complex questions with ease. Which
player had the most effective handballs inside 50? Which player gains
the most points from kicking it long? Who are the best spoilers in the
game?</p>
<p>These questions are just the beginning. I look forward to looking
into specific stats as preseason 2024 continues. To make sure you don’t
