<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Explaining the SuperCoach AFL scoring
system</h1>
<h4 class="author">Jaiden</h4>
<h4 class="date">Last updated on 2024-01-27</h4>

</div>


<p>SuperCoach AFL is a very popular fantasy sports game in Australia.
Footy fans become the ‘coach’ of a fantasy team, where each player is
scored each match based on their game performance. It has just opened to
the public for 2024 and avid punters can now put together their starting
squad.</p>
<p>The main premise of SuperCoach, and its scoring system in particular,
is that every action in a game of Australian Football has an impact on
the result of the match. Some actions are more important than others.
Players can determine a game in a shot for goal, or save their lead in a
massive pack-mark on the goal line. In essence, each statistic is scored
based on how much it improves the chances of winning.</p>
<p>However, this scoring system is kept secret - we essentially have to
believe what each player scores is legitimate. There is no definitive
list of which stats are included, or how collated stats get broken down,
leaving the community to guess what is going on.</p>
<div id="where-do-we-start" class="section level1">
<h1>Where do we start?</h1>
<p>I’ve spent the offseason researching the game of SuperCoach and which
stats might be included in the scoring system. This includes X
(Twitter), online AFL forums,
<a href= "https://www.championdata.com/glossary/afl/">the Champion Data
glossary</a>, but as a student I didn’t wanna pay up for a Herald Sun
subscription. It probably would’ve been wise in hindsight.</p>
<p>At the heart of the ranking points system is that it considers
players winning the ball, disposing of it, and where on the ground they
do it. It seems that we only need to focus on the things a player does
with the ball, plus a few of the simpler defensive actions. Straight
away, I can remove positional data like centre bounce attendances and
time on ground percentage, and also aggregated stats like total
disposals &amp; total clearances when we have better breakdowns already
available.</p>
<p>Last year, I attempted this same feat by applying “known” values to
each match. For example, we’ve heard that goals are worth 8 points.
While this is more useful than nothing, SuperCoach has deeper
intricacies in its scoring system. Unlike other fantasy games, ranking
points are weighted and adjusted by the time-elapsed in a match and the
current margin. This means that scoring in close games looks a lot
different to scoring in a blowout.</p>
<p>Finally, every regular-season game has 4 premiership points for the
winner, so the last step for SuperCoach is similar, ensuring there are
3300 total points allocated in each match.</p>
<p>After review of last year’s analysis, which had good (but unusable)
results, I decided that I need to get fancier. I needed more match
statistics than ever before, and it seemed there was enough variety
across AFL stats sources - the AFL website, the AFL app, Champion Data,
and other match centres.</p>
<p>With my research in mind, I came up with a plan of action: 1.
Collect, calculate and collate as many statistics as possible 2.
Determine the zone in which each stat occurred (D50, MID, F50) for more
precision 3. Create a model to weight all the stats with respect to each
player’s final score 4. Remove statistics that are insignificant or are
better described in more detail 5. Add scaling to the 3300 figure for
each match 6. Summarise the results and present the average value each
stat is worth</p>
<div id="sourcing-the-advanced-stats" class="section level2">
<h2>Sourcing the advanced stats</h2>
<p>You might be familiar with the possibilities of Stats Pro in the AFL
app. On mobile, you can watch player highlights in short clips of their
involvements for the match.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="img/supercoach_article/statspro.jpg"
alt="Will Hoskin-Elliott gathers and kicks the ball to seal Collingwood’s 2023 premiership!" />
<div class="figcaption">Will Hoskin-Elliott gathers and kicks the ball
to seal Collingwood’s 2023 premiership!</div>
</div>
<p>The best thing about this feature is that every stat is time-stamped.
I first started by downloading every player’s set of actions from each
match, and then combined them all in chronological order. This means we
can view each game from an individual stat perspective, and we can get
an idea of how the ball moves. Take this famous example from last season
- see if you can recognise it.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="img/supercoach_article/timestamps.png"
alt="An example of the data I am working with" />
<div class="figcaption">An example of the data I am working with</div>
</div>
<p>This has changed how I work with statistics for the fantasy
platforms, as I am now assessing player performance via when they win
the ball, the state in which they get involved (stoppages, turnover,
etc) and where on the ground they are. The last point is the key - we
know that SuperCoach points are likely to be boosted when in
defensive-50 or forward-50.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-model" class="section level2">
<h2>The model</h2>
<p>I’ve been collecting data from these sources, but unfortunately a lot
of it has been manual interpretation. This includes calculating kick
distances, kick direction, kick effectiveness, how the kick was
received, who generated score assists, whether each mark was from a
teammate or opponent, the result of spoils, kick-in playing on vs taking
it from the square, the result of hitouts… it is a complicated task. Oh,
and grouping every stat by D50, MID or F50 zones!</p>
<p>Assuming each recorded statistic is worth the same amount each game,
we should be able to calculate an ‘average’ points value for each stat
across all game scenarios - close or a blowout. As every game is worth
the same approximate 3300 points, the scaling should be similar across
all games too. What this means is that we can estimate what our players
typically get rewarded for a specific act on the footy field.</p>
<p>In <a href="fantasy.afl.com.au">AFL Fantasy</a>/DreamTeam, stats are
weighted equally. Every kick is worth 3 points, no matter when or where
it happened. The goal of this SuperCoach analysis is to give you an idea
of what each stat is worth, similar to how we associate +3 points with
every kick in AF/DT.</p>
<p>To find an average value for each statistic, I’ve decided to go with
a simple linear model where we try to minimise deviation from the real
score. My results yielded a R-squared value of 0.968, meaning that 96.8%
of variation in SuperCoach scoring is explained by this model. I think
that’s pretty good considering we aren’t scaling stats based on the
margin or how much of the game has elapsed! The mean absolute error
(MAE) for each SuperCoach score was 4.23, meaning that on average, this
model was only 4.23 points off the real SuperCoach score for each
player.</p>
<p>This is a <em>significant</em> improvement from the last time
<a href="https://jaidenpopowski.github.io/StatsByJaiden/">I tried to
figure out SuperCoach scoring</a>, which had results of 90.2% R-squared
and 7.81 MAE.</p>

hitouts aren’t accurate enough; I’ve gone halfway there by looking at
who wins first possession. If a ruck wins the hitout but first
possession is an opponent, I’ve called it a hitout to opposition. These
are around twice as common as ‘sharked hitouts’ as fumbling receives by
the initial midfielder aren’t recorded.</p>

ruck instead of tapping it (contested possession)</p>

<p><strong>Dropped Mark (Gain)</strong> - Dropping an uncontested mark

is scored as a possession</p>

<div id="whats-not-included" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s not included?</h3>
<p>Many common stats used in the AFL landscape are not actually included
in the all-encompassing SuperCoach formula. Typically these stats are
better broken down by stats already mentioned. For example, most
clearances have both a possession and a disposal that comprise a
clearance. I’m confident that these stats aren’t included based on their
lack of statistical significance on the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearances (better scored as possession + disposal)</li>
<li>Inside-50s (disposal + potential score/assist)</li>
<li>Metres Gained (long kicks bonus)</li>
<li>Hitouts (0)</li>
<li>Ineffective Kicks/Handballs (0)</li>
<li>Score Launches (usually involves an intercept)</li>
<li>Score Involvements (only the assist player or scorer)</li>
<li>Pressure Acts</li>
<li>Turnovers (40m+ long kicks can be effective yet still turn the ball
over)</li>
<li>Marking contest wins/losses (Contested Mark)</li>
<li>Intercepts (either intercept mark or a gather from opposition)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope you have gained some clarity on the facets that are important
for scoring in SuperCoach AFL. It’s been a long process and
<em>many</em> hours browsing Twitter, BigFooty and using the fancy
exploits of Google Search to gain info from paywalled articles.
Ultimately, we won’t ever get all the pieces due to intellectual
property policies, but I really wanted to understand where players
excel.</p>
<p>The benefit of this analysis is that unlike ever before, we can look
at how players score their points. Each game’s stats are now calculated
for all players and we can answer complex questions with ease. Which
player had the most effective handballs inside 50? Which player gains
the most points from kicking it long? Who are the best spoilers in the
game?</p>
<p>These questions are just the beginning. I look forward to looking
into specific stats as preseason 2024 continues. To make sure you don’t
miss out you can <a href="twitter.com/jaiden_popowski">Follow me on
Twitter/X</a> and <a href="instagram.com">follow me on Instagram</a>.
I’m always open to your questions so tag me in a post, I’d love to
answer!</p>
